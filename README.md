# CSE310-Compiler-Sessional

Laboratory works based on Introduction to compiling; Basic issues; Lexical analysis; Syntax analysis;
Syntax-directed translation; Semantic analysis: type-checking; Run-time environments; Intermediate code
generation; Code generation; Code optimization and project works using some lexical analyzer and parser
designing tools.

## Asignment 1 - SymbolTable

Relevant commands are described in the specs file.

How to run:
```bash
g++ main.cpp
./main.out filename.txt
```

## Assignment 2 - Lexical Analyser

How to run:

```bash
chmod +x command.sh
./command.sh filename.txt
```

## Assignment 3 - Parser

How to run:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh filename.txt
```

##### log.txt will contain relevant parser logs
##### error.txt will contain syntax and semantic errors if any

## Assignment 4 - Intermediate Code Generator (.c to 8086 asm)

```
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh filename.c
```

##### log.txt will contain relevant parser logs
##### error.txt will contain syntax and semantic errors if any
##### code.asm will contain assembly code
##### optimized-code.asm will contain optimized assembly code
